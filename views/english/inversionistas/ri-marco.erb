                  <h3>International </h3>

                  <p>Despite the volatile conditions in international markets and the skepticism concerning the pick-up
                    of world economic growth, we have seen heavy institutional investments from investment and pension
                    funds in Mexican instruments anchored to real estate, Fideicomiso de Inversión en Bienes Raíces
                    (“FIBRAs”, similar investment vehicles to United States’ REITs) and Certificados de Capital de
                    Desarrollo (“CKDs”, Development Capital Certificates), mainly from the U.S., U.K., France and
                    Canada; the demand for these instruments has intensified since the emergence of the first FIBRA in
                    the Mexican market in 2011.</p>

                  <p>The above derived from the sector’s positive growth outlook, coupled with the best cash
                    distributions and stock performance in the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (“BMV”), turning these type of
                    instruments into attractive investment options.</p>

                  <p>Meanwhile, China’s growth rate continues to slow down, going from a rate of 7.8% in 2013 to one of
                    7.4% in 2014; according to forecasts from the International Monetary Fund (“IMF”), it could drop to
                    6.8% and 6.3% in 2015 and 2016, respectively.</p>

                  <p>The IMF also projects a world economic growth rate of 3.5% in 2015 and one of 3.8% in 2016, years
                    in which we could observe a more sustainable growth in advanced economies, but a weakening in
                    emerging markets.</p>

                  <h3>National</h3>

                  <p>Although domestic consumption has seen a weak performance over the last six quarters, a recovery is anticipated, building on the recent enactment of the structural reforms (energy, telecommunications, and financial) and the expected positive effects from the Programa Nacional de Infraestructura (PNI). </p>

                  <p>The SHCP, Mexico’s Finance Ministry, expects that the GPD growth will gain momentum beginning with a gradual recovery in 2015, and finally achieving a 5% rate towards 2018. This is expected to be fully reflected throughout the purchasing power of Mexico’s middle class.</p>

                  <h3>Sectorial</h3>

                  <p>Recent initiatives of the Federal Government have targeted the reactivation of the Mexican financial market with the goal of attaining a higher rate of economic growth. These initiatives have found support in the soundness of the Mexican financial system, which still has low levels of funding for private endeavors, contrasting with Mexico’s Latin American (LatAm) peers and leaving room for opportunities in new funding instruments.</p>

                  <p>Notwithstanding the low levels of funding to the private sector, the total loans granted to the Mexican real estate sector in the last 5 years, particularly the non-residential construction sector, have steadily grown. Total loans surpassed the Ps.166 billion mark in 2013, providing solid proof of the dynamism in the sector.</p>

                  <p>According to CBRE [CBRE Research, Q4, 2013], the rental price of premium commercial and office properties in Mexico is lower than its LatAm peers (e.g. Santiago, Lima, Bogotá, Panama, and Sao Paulo), opening the possibility for an upward trend as the Mexican economy gains momentum.</p>
